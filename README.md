### Textbook and References

1. "Computational Physics"  by Mark Newman, 2013 (Revised and Expanded edition)
This is our main textbook that will present the basics of Python and the numerical techniques that we will learn in this course.

2. You may also find useful:
  "Effective Computation in Physics"   by Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn D. Huff 
which is available through Pitt subscription to SafariBooks Online.

  This textbook is designed as a useful guide to how to use Python, good software pratice, and tools like ```git``` as for effective scientific research.  However, it **does not** present a treatment of numerical details of integration, curve fitting, etc.  The main textbook is the reference for those details.

  To use the SafariBooks Online:  
    1. Start and log in at
       * http://www.library.pitt.edu/safari-tech-books-online
    2. And then search for “Effective Computation in Physics” or go directly to:
       * http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/physics/9781491901564

3. "A Whirlwind Tour of Python"  by Jake VanderPlas
        * http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf

4. Read through https://guides.github.com as the topics become appropriate.

5. We are fortunate to live in a rich, interconnected time in human history.  There is a wealth of information available online about each of the topics we will cover.  I encourage you to pursue additional materials, particularly on issues that you are having trouble understanding initially.

### Reading and Lecture Notes

Reading assignments are posted in the `lectures` `README.md`:  
https://github.com/pitt1321/lectures/

Lectures are posted under `week_[01][0-9]` subdirectories.  E.g.,

### Course Description 

Introductory physics courses are full of simplifications: projectiles fly without air resistance, pendulums swing only at small angles, no more than two particles move at any time, etc. These kinds of simplifications are necessary and appropriate when you’re first trying to understand the basic laws of nature, but the real world is far more complex, and far more interesting. Fortunately, modern electronic computers make it possible to perform extremely lengthy calculations in a negligible amount of time. In this course we will present several computational techniques and apply them to different problems in physics and astronomy.

### Learning Objectives

After completion of course students will be able to:

1. Find approximate solutions of typical nonlinear equations using various numerical techniques.
2. Evaluate derivatives to an expected accuracy using finite difference methods. 
3. Perform numerical integration using various algorithms.
4. Formulate numerical algorithms for the solution of single and multiple variable ordinary linear and non-linear differential equations in physics, such as simple harmonic motion, large angular motion of a pendulum, Van de Pol oscillator etc.
5. Use modern computer languages, version control, and collaborative tools to solve problems in physics. 
5. Write computer programs to implement the formulated numerical algorithms and output the calculated values of selected physical quantities to suitable data files
7. Propose analytic and computational solutions to a physical problem.
8. Explain a problem and its solution to peers through written and oral communication.
9. Read, assess, and critique a solution to a computational problem.

### Course Structure

Lectures will be interspersed with short exercises and in-class group work.  Students are expected to have read the relevant sections of the textbook (listed in the schedule below and on Courseweb) before class.  Daily short quizzes will test whether you have done the reading before the relevant material is covered in lecture.  There will be weekly homework assignments leading up to a final project as the culmination of your semester's learning.

#### Participation:

In this course you will be responsible for both your own and your colleagues's learning.  Participation will thus be assessed based on your contributions to your colleagues' learning through active participation in classroom discussion, code reviews, and discussion boards.

#### Lecture Quizzes:

There will be quizzes to encourage you to read and confront the material before class.  These quizzes will be generally given at the beginning of class.  The intent is to encourage you to be prepared for class and to wrestle with the material in preparation for further class discussion and learning.

### Assignments

Each week you will complete a homework assignment that uses the material for the current week and builds on previous material.

The assignment for each week will be available before the week’s class meetings. You should `fork` and `git clone` (download) the assignment and read it before the associated class meetings.  There will be time for you to start the assignment in class. You are encouraged to discuss the assignment with other students, but the work you turn in must be your own and you must understand everything you submit.  You will submit your assignment by issuing a "pull request" agains the original assignment repository.

You will receive feedback on your assignment from both me and your peers.

#### Final Project:

The final part of this course will be the final projects, which will be presented over the last 4 class days.  The grade will be based on a combination of the written material, including code quality, and the presentation quality.  There will be no final exam.

### Grading
Grades will be weighted as:

Percentage | Component
---------- | ---------
       50% | Assignments
       25% | Final project
       15% | Participation 
       10% | Lecture Quizzes

### GitHub

We will be using GitHub as our collaborative platform for the distribution, discussion, and submission of content in this course.  GitHub is a collaborative platform for developing and sharing code using modern tools and version control.  In particular, it uses the distributed version control system ```git```.  While GitHub will probably look complete different in 10 years, the ideas of sharable knowledge, collaboration, and version control are important ideas that will stay with you throughout your career.  There is an introduction to ```git``` at http://www.github.com, the supplemental textbook "Effective Computation in Physics", and many additional online tutorials.

Assignments will be implemented following the procedure at  
https://education.github.com/guide/forks
